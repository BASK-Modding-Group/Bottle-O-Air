# Bottle-O-Air
Adds a bottle of air to the game.
It's basically a poor man's respiration.

## Functionality
Drink a bottle o' air while under water and you'll refill your oxygen bar to full. After drinking, the bottle breaks and some bubble particles radiate gently from the head of the drinker. 

### Cork
When makeing stripped logs with savannah wood, you get cork as well as the stripped log. 

### Crafting
Craft a glass bottle with some cork and you'll get the bottle o' air! (Shapeless, or the bottle with the cork right above it?)
